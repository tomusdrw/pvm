# 🍍 anan-as

Assembly Script implementation of the JAM PVM (32bit).

#### Todo

- [ ] Memory
- [ ] [JAM tests](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/pull/3) compatibility
- [ ] 64-bit & new instructions ([GrayPaper v0.5.0](https://graypaper.fluffylabs.dev))

### Why?

- [Pineaples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ananas) are cool.
- [JAM](https://graypaper.com/) is promising.
- [PVM](https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm) is neat.


### Useful where?

- Potentially as an alternative implementation for [`typeberry`](https://github.com/fluffylabs).
- To test out the [PVM debugger](https://pvm.fluffylabs.dev).
